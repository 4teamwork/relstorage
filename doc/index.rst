 What is RelStorage?
=====================

RelStorage is a storage implementation for ZODB that stores pickles in
a relational database. PostgreSQL 8.1 and above (via psycopg2 or
psycopg2cffi), MySQL 5.0.32+ / 5.1.34+ (via MySQLdb 1.2.2 or PyMySQL),
and Oracle 10g and 11g (via cx_Oracle) are currently supported.
RelStorage replaced the PGStorage project.
